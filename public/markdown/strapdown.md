# This is a Markdown document
You can now write your web page in Markdown.
You opened a `textarea` tag, but a `xmp` tag works as well.
And, yes, it is **as simple** as **one** HTML line at the beginning and **one** HTML line at the end of this document.

## What to say more
Feel free to use it, redistribute it etc, *under the condition of the GPLv3 License*.

## Only for textual, simple documents
StrapDown.js is *awesome* to quickly build nice-looking web pages,
but it might not be efficient for anything more complicated, as it is really not designed for it.

## Add a picture ?
With Markdown syntax, it's easy : ![GA|Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-38514290-14/example2.html "Thanks to ga-beacon").

### An other one ?
Alright, here comes the mighty Cthulhu ![Logo Squirt](../squirt/images/logo.png "Logo Cthulhu")

### A last one, because it's dangerous to go alone :

![Logo Take this from dotcore](../squirt/images/takethis.jpg "Logo «Take this» from dotcore")

## Add anything you want, it *might* work
For instance, you can add use Google Analytics to monitor the page's activity,
with including a piece of Javascript code, before *or* after closing the *textarea* tag.
